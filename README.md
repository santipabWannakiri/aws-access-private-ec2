## Introduction
Public IP addresses have long been a convenient means for direct access to EC2 instances. However, as of February 1, 2024, AWS has introduced charges for public IPv4 addresses. This means that even small POC instances with Auto-Assigned Public IPs will incur charges. In light of this, alternative methods for accessing EC2 instances without relying on public IPs are being explored.

## EC2 Instance without public IPv4 
Creating a subnet within a VPC and launching EC2 instances in that subnet is considered a best practice for enhancing security. This approach ensures that the EC2 instances do not directly receive public IPv4 addresses. This is particularly advantageous when the instances running the application are not directly involved with or connected to end-users. In such scenarios, providing public IPv4 addresses to these instances is unnecessary, aligning with security best practices.
